// The conditional-request validator a dynamic response answers with.
//
// A server-side cache key can name a representation perfectly and still hand
// the client the wrong answer, because the client does not compare keys - it
// compares validators. The prod server used to derive a non-HTML entry's
// validator from `raw.length` plus the cookie (BUG.md AM): an anonymous
// reader's cookie is the empty string, so the validator only moved when the
// byte count moved. Two equal-length representations with different bytes - a
// same-length typo fix, a re-rendered feed of the same size - therefore shared
// one validator, and every conditional request against the newer entry answered
// 304 with the older bytes: a false 304 that survives until the length changes.
//
// The rule that closes it is content-derived and cheap: hash what is about to
// go on the wire. sha1 is not a collision-resistant signature any more, but a
// validator only needs the property that a byte change flips it, and RFC 9110
// lets a weak validator (`W/"..."`) be answered with 200 whenever the client's
// copy is not byte-equivalent. sha1 over a render that already cost a route
// lookup and a serialization is noise on the budget.
//
// Ownership still belongs to the origin server: an app that publishes its own
// `ETag` keeps it. The framework only synthesizes one where the response has
// none, so an application-side validator (a database version stamp, a content
// hash of the pre-serialized row) is never silently replaced underneath a
// client that cached it.
